# 448. Happy Number
## `Description`
### Write an algorithm to determine if a number is happy.
### A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
## `Example`

### `19` is a happy number
### 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
### 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
### 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
### 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

```python
class Solution:
    # @param {int} n an integer
    # @return {boolean} true if this is a happy number or false
    def isHappy(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        d = {}
        while True:
            d[n] = 1
            n = sum([int(x) * int(x) for x in list(str(n))])
            if n == 1 or n in d:
                break
        return n == 1
```
