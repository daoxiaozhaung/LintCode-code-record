# 627. Longest Palindrome
## `Description`
### Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
### This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.
## `Example`
### Given s = `"abccccdd"` return `7`
### One longest palindrome that can be built is `"dccaccd"`, whose length is `7`.
```python
class Solution:
    # @param {string} s a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters
    # @return {int} the length of the longest palindromes that can be built
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        slist = list(s)
        slist.sort()
        result = []
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(slist) - 1:
            if slist[i] == slist[i+1]:
                i += 2
                j += 2
            else:
                i += 1
        if j < len(slist):
            return j + 1
        else:
            return j
```
