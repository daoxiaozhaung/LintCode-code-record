# 93. Balanced Binary Tree
## `Description`
`Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.`
`For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.`
## `Example`
Given binary tree `A = {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}`, `B = {3,#,20,15,7}`
The binary tree A is a height-balanced binary tree, but B is not.
