# 372. Delete Node in the Middle of Singly Linked List
## `Description`
### Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
```python
"""
Definition of ListNode
class ListNode(object):

    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
"""
class Solution:
    # @param node: the node in the list should be deleted
    # @return: nothing
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        # write your code here
        if node is None or node.next is None:
            return
        next = node.next
        node.val = next.val
        node.next = next.next
        return
```
