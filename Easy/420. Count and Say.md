# 420. Count and Say
## `Description`
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

`1`, `11`, `21`, `1211`, `111221`,` ...`

`1` is read off as` "one 1" `or `11`.

`11` is read off as` "two 1s" `or `21`.

`21` is read off as` "one 2, then one 1" `or `1211`.

Given an integer `n`, generate the `n`th sequence.
```python
class Solution:
    # @param {int} n the nth
    # @return {string} the nth sequence
    def count(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        t = ''
        count = 0
        curr = '#'
        for i in s:
            if i != curr:
                if curr != '#':
                    t += str(count) + curr
                curr = i
                count = 1
            else:
                count += 1
        t += str(count) + curr
        return t

    def countAndSay(self, n):
        s = '1'
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            s = self.count(s)
        return s
```
