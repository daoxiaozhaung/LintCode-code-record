# 445. Cosine Similarity
## `Description`
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle.

See wiki: Cosine Similarity

Here is the formula:<br>

cosine-similarity

Given two vectors A and B with the same size, calculate the cosine similarity.

Return `2.0000` if cosine similarity is invalid (for example A = [0] and B = [0]).
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param A: An integer array.
    @param B: An integer array.
    @return: Cosine similarity.
    """
    def cosineSimilarity(self, A, B):
        # write your code here
        if len(A) != len(B):
            return 2
        
        n = len(A)
        up = 0
        for i in xrange(n):
            up += A[i] * B[i]
        down = sum(a*a for a in A) * sum(b*b for b in B)
        if down == 0:
            return 2
        return up / math.sqrt(down)
```
