# 85. Insert Node in a Binary Search Tree
## `Description`
### Given a binary search tree and a new tree node, insert the node into the tree. You should keep the tree still be a valid binary search tree.
```python

class Solution:

    @param root: The root of the binary search tree.
    @param node: insert this node into the binary search tree.
    @return: The root of the new binary search tree.
